Name: Add type hints for UML class diagram
Type: Enhancement
Priority: Medium
Description: Add type hints using Python’s typing module (e.g., List, Optional) to instance variables and method parameters/return types to clarify relationships for PyCharm’s UML diagram. I’ll ensure proper imports, preserve all comments, and follow PEP 8. The goal is to make associations (e.g., AppController → UIManager), dependencies, and compositions (e.g., Prayer → Category) visible in the UML diagram.
