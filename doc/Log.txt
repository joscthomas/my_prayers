HONOR GOD

I will praise the Lord at all times. I will constantly speak his praises. I will
boast only in the Lord; let all who are helpless take heart. Come, let us tell
of the Lord's greatness; let us exalt his name together.

Psalms 34:1-3 NLT

Consider what it means to bless God at all times.


After you've done this, spend some time praising the name of the Lord right now.
