- 1. `git status` – Make sure your current area is clean.  
- 2. `git pull` – Get the latest version from the remote. This saves merging issues later.  
- 3. Edit your files and make your changes. Remember to run your linter and do [unit tests](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)!  
- 4. `git status` – Find all files that are changed. Make sure to watch untracked files too!  
- 5. ` git add [files]` – Add the changed files to the staging area.  
- 6. `git commit -m "message"` – Make your new commit.  
- 7. `git push origin [branch-name]` – Push your changes up to the remote.

Is this a batch file? Some kind of command file. Where does it run? What is the language?

(state of git: there are modified files in staging)  

This job is a continuous integration pipeline that does stuff
upon pushes of source code to the master branch of the repository. 

Step 1
    Analyze source code 
    Run all python *.py files thru the linter
    output: error report
    decision: stop or proceed
    (and other source code analysis tools)
Step 2
    Run test suite (pytest)
    set up a virtual environment
    output: pass or fail with errors
    decision: stop or proceed
Step 3
    Run code coverage analysis https://about.codecov.io/?ref=hackernoon.com
Step 4
    Check data types (mypy)
Step 5
    Build a package ?? (pypa?)
Step 6
    Publish package ?? (pypi?)
Step 7
    send notification of results
Step 8
    Build and publish documentation
Step 9
    Check in code to repo
